To start your project on a local server, you'll need to follow these general steps:
Setup a Local Server: You can use tools like Node.js with the http-server package, Python's http.server, or other web server software to set up a local server.
For Node.js, you can use http-server by installing it globally:
sh
```npm install -g http-server```

Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your command line (terminal) and navigate to the directory where your project files are located.
Start the Local Server: Run the local server command to start serving your project files:
For `http-server`:
sh
```http-server```

For Python:
sh
```python -m http.server```


Replace http-server or python -m http.server with the actual command based on the server software you're using.
Access Your Project: Once the server is running, it will display a local URL (like http://localhost:8080) in your terminal. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to access your project.
Remember that this is a simplified explanation, and the exact steps may vary based on your specific environment. If you're using more advanced development tools like webpack, React, or Vue, the setup might differ.
Also, keep in mind that the server might need to be restarted when you make changes to your code for them to take effect.
Lastly, ensure that the background image and other assets are properly linked using relative paths, as local servers often serve content from different URLs than file-based access.
